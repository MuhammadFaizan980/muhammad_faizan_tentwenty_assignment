# faizan_tentwenty_assignment

This project utilizes:
1) Providers in combination with controllers and Change Notifiers for state management
2) Dependency Injection in centralised using GetIt package
3) Floor is used as SQLite wrapper for caching locally
4) Cache Network Images package is used for caching images locally

Project Structure is quite simple, directory names are self explaining their purposes.
Unfortunately I have not done much documentation stuff so, dont really know what to write or what to not.

Looking forward for you feed back.
